### **1.0 The Vision: What is Geek Protocol?**

In the digital universe, knowledge is power. Geek Protocol is a decentralized Web3 ecosystem built on the high-speed Kaspa network, designed for a single purpose: to create a home where geeks can learn, compete, and monetize their expertise in a self-sustaining, community-driven economy.

We are building a trustless ecosystem that rewards passion. Whether you are a master of sci-fi lore, a coding prodigy, or a history buff, your knowledge has value here. Our platform combines gamified learning (Quiz2Earn), digital ownership (NFTs), and a community-driven content engine, all hosted by our unique AI, A.C.E.

Welcome to the future of fandom.

### **2.0 The Ecosystem**

The Geek Protocol is more than just a quiz; it's a multi-layered, interactive world.

#### **2.1 Quiz2Earn: The Geek Gauntlet**
The heart of our platform is the "Geek Gauntlet," a challenging trivia game designed to test your knowledge and reward your skill.

* **100-Question Challenge:** A standard game consists of 10 rounds of 10 questions each.
* **Dynamic Challenge:** The difficulty increases as you progress, with the final rounds reserved for true experts.
* **Strategic Gameplay:** Use in-game lifelines like "50/50" and "Ask the Fandom" to gain an edge.
* **Daily Competitions:** Compete in unique, themed "Daily Challenges" for a chance to win from a larger prize pool.

#### **2.2 Create & Customize: Your Geek Identity**
Your passion deserves recognition. On Geek Protocol, you can build your own unique identity.

* **Customizable Avatars:** Every user gets their own "Giga" bot avatar, which can be customized with unique apparel and accessories.
* **The In-Game Store:** Use your earned `$GEEK` to purchase new avatar items, lifelines, premium quiz packs, and more.
* **Peer-to-Peer Marketplace:** Trade your cosmetic items and other digital collectibles directly with other members of the community through an on-chain marketplace smart contract.

#### **2.3 The Community Content Engine**
Our platform is built by geeks, for geeks. To ensure our content library is vast and ever-growing, users can:

* **Submit Questions:** Create and submit questions for your favorite categories.
* **Peer Review:** Become a trusted "Verifier" to help maintain the quality of our quizzes.
* **Earn Creator Rewards:** Receive `$GEEK` for every approved question and earn a long-term passive revenue share from platform fees generated by your content.
