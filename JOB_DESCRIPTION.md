Job Description: Freelance Full-Stack Developer (Web3/Kaspa) - Build a Fun Quiz2Earn MVP
Project: Geek Protocol ($GEEK)
Role: Short-Term Freelance Developer
Location: Remote (Global)
Duration: 4-6 Week Contract
Budget: Competitive, paid in $KAS

About Us:
Geek Protocol is a pre-launch Web3 project with a mission to become the ultimate hub for geek culture on the Kaspa network. We're building a top-tier gamified ecosystem where users can learn, compete in high-stakes trivia, and earn rewards. Think "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" meets the community spirit of Discord.

Our project is fully planned, with a comprehensive blueprint, finalized tokenomics, and a live community presence. We are now seeking a talented freelance developer to build our Testnet MVP and bring the core concept to life.

Your Mission: Build the Testnet MVP
Over a 4-6 week period, you will be responsible for building a functional prototype of our Quiz2Earn dApp on the Kaspa Testnet (TN10). This MVP is the most critical piece of our upcoming funding proposal.

Core MVP Features to Build:

Wallet Connection: A frontend interface that allows users to connect their Kaspium (or other Kaspa-compatible) wallet.

Basic Quiz Flow: A simple UI where a user can play one round of 10 questions from a single, pre-defined category.

Score Tracking: A backend process that validates answers and calculates the user's score.

On-Chain Rewards: Upon completion of the quiz, the backend must automatically trigger a transaction that sends a pre-determined amount of Testnet $GEEK tokens to the user's wallet.

Required Tech Stack & Skills:

Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS (or similar).

Backend: Node.js.

Web3: Strong experience with Ethers.js (or equivalent) for wallet interaction.

Blockchain: Demonstrable ability to interact with a blockchain network from a backend application. Direct experience with Kaspa is a huge plus, but experience with any blockchain and a willingness to learn the Kaspa SDK is essential.

Full-Stack Mentality: You should be comfortable working on both the frontend and backend to deliver this self-contained product.

The Ideal Candidate:

Is a self-starter who can take a detailed plan and execute it efficiently.

Has a strong portfolio of live dApps or Web3 projects.

Is an excellent communicator and comfortable with regular check-ins.

Is passionate about crypto-gaming and building cool, user-facing products.

What We Provide:

A complete Master Project Document detailing all aspects of the project.

A finalized Litepaper and all branding assets (logos, character art, etc.).

A clear vision and direct access to the project founder.

A competitive budget for this fixed-scope contract.

To Apply:
Please provide a link to your portfolio or GitHub and a brief note explaining why you are excited about this project and your relevant experience.
