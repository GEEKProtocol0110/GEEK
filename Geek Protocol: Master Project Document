*Last Updated: July 4, 2025*
*Version: 1.1*

### **1.0 Introduction & Vision**
Geek Protocol is a Web3-based ecosystem for social learning and gaming, centered around a "Quiz2Earn" model. Our mission is to build the definitive decentralized platform where geeks can learn, compete, and monetize their expertise in a self-sustaining, community-driven economy.

### **2.0 Core Gameplay & Features**
The core of the platform is an engaging and competitive trivia experience.

* **Primary Game Mode ("The Geek Gauntlet"):** A full game session consists of **10 rounds of 10 questions each** (100 questions total).
* **Increasing Difficulty:** The challenge progresses through three tiers: Apprentice (Rounds 1-4), Adept (Rounds 5-7), and Master (Rounds 8-10).
* **Strict Time Limit:** Each question has a 15-second timer to encourage quick recall and reward expertise.
* **Power-Ups/Lifelines:** Players can earn or purchase strategic lifelines:
    * **50/50:** Removes two incorrect answers.
    * **Ask the Fandom:** Reveals what percentage of other players chose each answer.
    * **Extra Time:** Adds 10 seconds to the timer.
* **Daily Challenges:** A unique, themed gauntlet is featured each day with a larger prize pool to encourage daily participation.

### **3.0 The In-Game Economy**
A robust "meta-game" built around the core quiz loop to drive engagement and token utility.

* **User Character Customization:** Each user has a personal avatar based on the "Giga" mascot. Avatars have customizable slots:
    * Headwear
    * Tops
    * Handheld Item
* **In-Game Store & Purchases:** A dedicated shop, hosted by the AI A.C.E., where users can spend `$GEEK` on 7 types of items:
    1.  **Lifeline Packs** (Consumable)
    2.  **Premium Quiz Packs** (Content)
    3.  **"Hardcore Mode" Access Pass** (Content)
    4.  **Avatar Frame Packs** (Cosmetic)
    5.  **Custom Titles** (Cosmetic)
    6.  **GEEK-Wear Apparel** (Customization)
    7.  **Creator's Loot Box** (Randomized)
* **Peer-to-Peer Marketplace:** A marketplace for users to buy and sell cosmetic and character customization items from each other using `$GEEK`. All transactions include a small platform fee that fuels the economic engine.

### **4.0 $GEEK Tokenomics**
The economic engine is designed for long-term growth and sustainability.

* **Token Details:**
    * **Name:** Geek Protocol
    * **Ticker:** `$GEEK`
    * **Blockchain:** Kaspa
    * **Standard:** KRC-20
* **Economic Engine (Burn & Recycle):** All platform fees (from the marketplace, in-game store, etc.) are subject to a **70/30 split** handled by the smart contract:
    * **70% is Recycled** back into the player rewards pool.
    * **30% is Permanently Burned**.
* **Allocation & Release Schedule:**
| Category | Allocation | Total Tokens | Release Plan |

### **5.0 Content & Community Strategy**
Content is the lifeblood of the platform, sourced via a two-phased, community-centric strategy.

* **Launch Categories:** The platform will launch with 8 primary categories:
    1.  Sci-Fi Cinema & TV
    2.  Fantasy Literature & Games
    3.  Video Games
    4.  Anime & Manga
    5.  Comics & Superheroes
    6.  Technology & Computing History
    7.  Science & Futurism
    8.  Tabletop & Board Games
* **Premium Content:** Specialized categories like **"Blockchain History"** and **"Kaspa Ecosystem"** will be available as purchasable premium quiz packs.
* **Community Content Engine:** A post-launch "Quiz Contributor Portal" will allow users to submit and peer-review new questions. Creators will be rewarded with `$GEEK` and a long-term passive revenue share for approved content.

### **6.0 Brand & Character Guide**
Geek Protocol utilizes a unique two-character strategy to create a rich brand identity.

* **A.C.E. (Automated Cerebral Emulator) - The "Brains":** The in-game host and guide. A.C.E. is a sleek, holographic AI with a sharp, analytical, and data-driven personality.
* **Giga - The "Face":** The official community mascot. Giga is a friendly, fun, and approachable robot character used in marketing, on social media, and as the base model for user avatars.

### **7.0 Technical Architecture & Stack**
The platform will be built on a modern, scalable, and robust technology stack.

| Component | Technology | Purpose |

### **8.0 Testing & Deployment Plan**
A phased approach ensures a secure and stable launch.

* **Phase 1: Testnet Validation:** All features will be rigorously tested on the **Kaspa TN10 testnet**. This includes deploying and testing all KRC-20 smart contracts (rewards, staking, marketplace), NFT minting, and the burn/recycle mechanics with testnet assets.
* **Phase 2: Mainnet Deployment:** Following a comprehensive pre-launch checklist (including smart contract audits), the platform will be deployed:
    * **Frontend:** Deployed to **Vercel** via a Git-based workflow.
    * **Backend:** Deployed to **Heroku**, with the database on **MongoDB Atlas**.
    * **Smart Contracts:** Deployed to the Kaspa mainnet.
